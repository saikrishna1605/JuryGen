# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Generative AI Legal Companion is a comprehensive AI-driven solution that demystifies complex legal documents by transforming them into accessible, actionable guidance. The system accepts multi-modal inputs (PDFs, images, documents, voice) and provides multi-modal outputs (text summaries, translations, audio narration, voice-to-voice interactions) while maintaining privacy-by-design architecture and jurisdiction-aware legal grounding.

### Requirement 4: Voice-to-Voice Legal Q&A

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask questions about my legal document using voice input and receive spoken responses so that I can get immediate clarification hands-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user speaks a question THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text using Speech-to-Text API
2. WHEN a voice question is processed THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant context using Vector Search
3. WHEN generating voice responses THEN the system SHALL use Gemini 1.5 Pro for grounded answers with citations
4. WHEN 'Read Aloud' is enabled THEN the system SHALL synthesize responses using Cloud Text-to-Speech
5. WHEN audio plays THEN the system SHALL highlight referenced clauses with synchronized captions
6. IF voice input is unclear THEN the system SHALL request clarification or offer text input alternative

### Requirement 5: Multi-Language Support and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a non-English speaker or user with accessibility needs, I want the system to support multiple languages and accessibility features so that I can use the service effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translation is requested THEN the system SHALL translate summaries and analysis using Cloud Translation API
2. WHEN audio narration is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide synchronized captions (SRT format)
3. WHEN accessibility mode is activated THEN the system SHALL support high-contrast themes and font scaling
4. WHEN dyslexia-friendly mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL use appropriate fonts and spacing
5. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide proper focus management and ARIA labels
6. IF screen readers are detected THEN the system SHALL provide optimized content structure and descriptions

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Export and Sharing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my analysis results in multiple formats so that I can share findings with others or keep records for future reference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN export is requested THEN the system SHALL generate highlighted PDF with risk annotations
2. WHEN document export is needed THEN the system SHALL create DOCX summaries with track changes
3. WHEN data export is required THEN the system SHALL provide CSV files with clause analysis data
4. WHEN audio export is requested THEN the system SHALL generate MP3 narration with SRT transcripts
5. WHEN sharing is needed THEN the system SHALL create shareable links with appropriate access controls
6. IF collaborative review is required THEN the system SHALL support multi-party access with role-based permissions

### Requirement 7: Privacy and Security Compliance

**User Story:** As a user handling sensitive legal documents, I want robust privacy protection and security measures so that my confidential information remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)
2. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL scan for PII using Cloud DLP and mask sensitive data
3. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL implement automatic lifecycle deletion (30 days default)
4. WHEN user consent is required THEN the system SHALL provide explicit opt-in for any model training usage
5. WHEN data residency matters THEN the system SHALL offer region selection for data storage
6. IF security threats are detected THEN the system SHALL use Cloud Armor WAF and reCAPTCHA protection

### Requirement 8: Jurisdiction-Aware Legal Grounding

**User Story:** As a user in a specific jurisdiction, I want legal analysis that considers local laws and regulations so that the advice is relevant to my legal context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN jurisdiction is specified THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant local statutes using BigQuery legal databases
2. WHEN providing legal citations THEN the system SHALL reference applicable laws with jurisdiction flags
3. WHEN risk analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL consider jurisdiction-specific legal precedents
