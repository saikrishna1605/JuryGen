# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive code review and refactoring requirements for the Legal Companion AI-powered legal document analysis application. The project consists of a React TypeScript frontend, FastAPI Python backend, and various cloud services integrations. The goal is to eliminate all bugs, security vulnerabilities, hardcoded values, and code quality issues while optimizing the application for production deployment.

## Requirements

2. WHEN environment files are examined THEN the system SHALL contain no hardcoded API keys, secrets, or sensitive URLs
3. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL use proper environment variable validation with type checking and default values
4. WHEN Firebase configuration is initialized THEN the system SHALL validate all required Firebase environment variables are present
5. WHEN production deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL use secure credential management (not plain text files)

### Requirement 2: Code Quality and Standards Compliance

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want the codebase to follow consistent coding standards and best practices, so that the code is maintainable, readable, and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is analyzed THEN the system SHALL have zero linting errors and warnings
2. WHEN TypeScript code is compiled THEN the system SHALL have zero type errors
3. WHEN Python code is analyzed THEN the system SHALL follow PEP 8 standards and have proper type hints
4. WHEN functions are defined THEN the system SHALL have proper JSDoc/docstring documentation
5. WHEN imports are organized THEN the system SHALL follow consistent import ordering and grouping
6. WHEN naming conventions are applied THEN the system SHALL use consistent camelCase/snake_case patterns per language

### Requirement 3: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the application, so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors with proper context, timestamps, and request IDs
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users while logging technical details
3. WHEN exceptions are thrown THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing the application
4. WHEN logging is configured THEN the system SHALL use structured logging with appropriate log levels
5. WHEN errors are handled THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive information in error messages

### Requirement 4: Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the application to load quickly and respond efficiently, so that I can analyze legal documents without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are loaded THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading for non-critical components
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper caching strategies
3. WHEN large files are processed THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without memory leaks
4. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL be optimized for performance
5. WHEN bundle size is analyzed THEN the system SHALL have optimized bundle sizes with code splitting

### Requirement 5: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage and reliable testing infrastructure, so that bugs are caught before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL have at least 80% code coverage for critical paths
2. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN the system SHALL test all business logic functions
3. WHEN integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL test API endpoints and database interactions
4. WHEN end-to-end tests are executed THEN the system SHALL test complete user workflows
5. WHEN test suites are run THEN the system SHALL complete without failures or flaky tests

### Requirement 6: Dependency Management and Security

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want all dependencies to be up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities, so that the application is secure from supply chain attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are scanned THEN the system SHALL have zero high or critical security vulnerabilities
2. WHEN package versions are checked THEN the system SHALL use the latest stable versions where possible
3. WHEN deprecated packages are found THEN the system SHALL replace them with modern alternatives
4. WHEN dependency conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL resolve them properly
5. WHEN security audits are run THEN the system SHALL pass all security checks

### Requirement 7: Deployment and Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the application to be easily deployable with proper containerization and infrastructure as code, so that deployments are consistent and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker containers are built THEN the system SHALL use multi-stage builds for optimization
2. WHEN deployment configurations are applied THEN the system SHALL use proper health checks and readiness probes
3. WHEN environment-specific configs are used THEN the system SHALL support development, staging, and production environments
4. WHEN infrastructure is provisioned THEN the system SHALL use infrastructure as code principles
5. WHEN deployments occur THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments

### Requirement 8: Accessibility and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the application to be fully accessible and follow WCAG guidelines, so that I can use all features regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessibility is tested THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
2. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN the system SHALL be fully navigable without a mouse
3. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and descriptions
4. WHEN color contrast is measured THEN the system SHALL meet minimum contrast ratios
5. WHEN focus management is tested THEN the system SHALL have proper focus indicators and management

### Requirement 9: API Design and Documentation

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want well-designed APIs with comprehensive documentation, so that I can integrate with backend services efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are designed THEN the system SHALL follow RESTful principles and consistent naming
2. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL use consistent response formats and status codes
3. WHEN API documentation is generated THEN the system SHALL have complete OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
4. WHEN API versioning is implemented THEN the system SHALL support backward compatibility
5. WHEN API validation is applied THEN the system SHALL validate all input parameters and request bodies

### Requirement 10: Monitoring and Observability
